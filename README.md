# Mall Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to the popular *Mall Customers* dataset for unsupervised customer segmentation. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters based on their income and spending score — a key step in customer profiling for targeted marketing.

## 📂 Dataset
We use the [Mall Customers dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/mall_customers.csv).

Features:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## 🚀 What’s inside
- 📊 Visual exploration of data  
- 🔍 Elbow Method to find optimal K  
- 🧠 K-Means clustering and cluster label assignment  
- 🎨 Cluster visualization  
- ✅ Clustering quality evaluation using Silhouette Score  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  

## ⚡ Quick Start

1️⃣ Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kmeans-mall-customer-segmentation.git
cd kmeans-mall-customer-segmentation
2️⃣ Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
3️⃣ Run the notebook or script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python kmeans_clustering.py
or
Open Mall_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb in Jupyter/Colab.

📈 Example Results

Elbow Method plot and Silhouette Score will also be generated.

📌 Evaluation Metric
We use Silhouette Score to validate clustering quality:

Edit
Silhouette Score > 0.5 indicates reasonable clusters.
💡 Future Improvements
Integrate PCA for high-dimensional data visualization

Allow dynamic selection of features for clustering
